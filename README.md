## Test Output

When you run a test, it's either going to pass or fail. When it fails, you'll be presented with a big red dot with  of text. This is called a stack trace and, though intimidating, does contain some useful information.

One of the core skills of a developer is debugging. By clicking on the test you can see the Stack Trace, which classes & files the failure happened, and gives you a line number at the end. Most of the lines in the stack trace are irrelevant most of the time, you want to try and identify the files that you're actually working with.
